Exchange mailboxes @ OVH backup tool
-------------------------

This script will help you backup Exchange mailboxes hosted at OVH.
It uses the API provided to backup .pst files.

Please note that this is a heavy process, that's why I recommand doing backup ~ once in a week.

NOT WORKING ANYMORE ON PRIVATE REPOSITORY
-----------------------------------------
OVH API, on private repo, now answers with : 
```
Error when requesting new export. Message: Creation of exports on private version of exchange is unavailable. Please use feature of impersonatedUser instead.
```

Usage (CHANGED IN 1.0)
-----
There is now two scripts : 
* prepare.php : retrieve account list
* backup.php : needed to be run for each account.

You need to paste your credentials in parameters.ini

Then you may program the following crontab: 
```
# Backup every monday morning on a new folder
0 0 * * 1 /path/to/prepare.php /backup/folder/$(date +"\%Y\%m\%d")

# Backup two accounts at a time with max exec == 4h
1 0 * * 1 xargs -n1 -P2 timeout 14400 /path/to/backup.php  < /backup/folder/$(date +"\%Y\%m\%d")/accounts.txt
```

Requirements
-------------
This script uses PHP and is working with all versions >= 5.2

Generate credentials
--------------------
- Obtain Application key and application secret at https://api.ovh.com
- Generate a consumer key (CK) with access to resources /email/exchange. You can do it by executing following query :
(note : I was unable to get a working token with path: "/email/exchange". Was forced to access /* ... ) 
(note2: DELETE grant is needed, because one export request can be made at a time, and we need to delete old exports before doing new ones).

```
curl -XPOST -H"X-Ovh-Application: REPLACEMEPLEASE" -H "Content-type: application/json" \
https://eu.api.ovh.com/1.0/auth/credential  -d '{
    "accessRules": [
        {
            "method": "GET",
            "path": "/email/exchange/*"
        },
        {
            "method": "POST",
            "path": "/email/exchange/*"
        },
        {
            "method": "DELETE",
            "path": "/email/exchange/*"
        }
    ]
}'
```
